.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBjcal\fR [\fB\-3L\fR] [[\fImonth\fR] [\fIyear\fR]]

.sp
\fBjcal\fR [\fB\-3L\fR] \fB\-m\fR \fImonth\fR [\fIyear\fR]

.sp
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBjcal\fR displays a simple calendar in tradition format\&.

.sp
The weekday symbols are locale and language oriented,
so if your system language is non-english or your locale where gregorian calendar is not the default one,
the calendar could be wild wide!
Otherwise, a 27x13 terminal should be suffice a month\&.
For the year, do the math~

.sp
The options are as follows:

.sp
.TP
\fB\-3\fR
Display the previous, current and next month surrounding today\&.

.TP
\fB\-L\fR
Display the lunar (along with gregorian) calendar\&.

.TP
\fB\-m\fR \fImonth\fR
Display the specified \fImonth\fR\&.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Display the manual, which you're reading now\&.

.RS 0
.sp
A single parameter specifies the year (1-9999) to be displayed\&.
Note the year must be fully specifed: ``jcal 18'' will \fInot\fR display a calendar for 2018\&.
Two parameters denote the month and the year\&.
The month is a number between 1 and 12\&.
Month and year default to those of the current system clock and time zone (so ``jcal -m 10'' will display a calendar for the month of October in the current year)\&.

.sp
These options can be used together. For instance ``-3 -L -m 10'' would mean: show me the three month around the tenth month with lunar date\&.

.sp
Highlighting of dates is setting the font foreground color to red, so if your terminal's background is red, it could be ambiguous\&.
Underline is always supported\&.
